The wiki accepts any content that is broadly **interesting** or **useful** to the Ubuntu community.

The content is not restricted to engineering topics. 
If you are interested in other topics, like design or art, your contributions are also welcome.

## What content is suitable for the wiki?

Here is how you might approach answering this question.
