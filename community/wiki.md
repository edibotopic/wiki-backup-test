# Contribute

We welcome all kinds of contributions to the Ubuntu wiki.

## Example contributions

* Fixing errors
* Updating content
* Creating pages

## Types of content

The wiki accepts any content that is broadly **interesting** or **useful** to the Ubuntu community.

This could include:

* Technical how-to guides and tutorials
* Technical explanations and references
* Case-studies of Ubuntu usage
* Small tips and hacks

The content is not restricted to engineering topics. 
If you are interested in other topics, like design or art, your contributions are also welcome.

## What content is suitable for the wiki?

Here is how you might approach answering this question.

    B -- Yes --> C[Don't add it]
    B -- No --> D[Add and tag it]
    C --> E[Consider improving the existing page]
    D --> F[Bookmark it]
    F --> G[Edit your work for accuracy, clarity and quality]

```
