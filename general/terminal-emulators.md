# Terminal emulators

A *terminal emulator* is an application that simulates a physical computer terminal. This enables users to interact with a machine through a text-based interface that they can give commands.

Terminal emulators give users the ability to interact with their local machine or other machines via remote connections such as [SSH]().


## Common terminal emulators

* [GNOME Terminal](/general/gnome-terminal)
* [Konsole]()
* [Terminator]()
* [Termux]()
