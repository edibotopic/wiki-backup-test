# Desktop environments

*Desktop environments* are groups of packages that provide a graphical means for users to interact with their machine. These provide the common elements most users expect when booting up their machine, such as toolbars, app icons, file explorers, and so on.

These are usually bundles of applications from the same developer, such as [GNOME](/general/gnome-desktop) or [KDE](), but these applications can typically be swapped should you prefer one specific application over another.

The default desktop environment for Ubuntu Desktop is [GNOME](/general/gnome-desktop.md), but there are several other community-maintained versions of Ubuntu that come pre-packaged with different desktop environments. These are known as [Ubuntu flavours](/ubuntu/flavours).
