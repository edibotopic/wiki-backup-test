Ubuntu is designed to be easy-to-use but is also suitable for advanced users.

# Technology

Ubuntu is built on top of the Debian, a free and open source Linux distribution.

The Ubuntu Desktop environment is based on GNOME.

Ubuntu is also used in servers, clouds and robots.

# History

Mark Shuttleworth founded Canonical and is its acting CEO.

The development and maintenance of Ubuntu is funded by Canonical Ltd.

# Business

Canonical creates open source software, including Ubuntu.

It also provides features and support for enterprise users.

Ubuntu's well-defined release cycle has gained it a reputation for stability.

# Release cycle

Each six months, a new version of Ubuntu is released.

Long term support (LTS) releases come every two years in April.

This regular cadence and the support provided, makes Ubuntu a highly-stable Linux distribution.
