Ubuntu is designed to be easy-to-use, while also being suitable for advanced users.

# Technology

Ubuntu is built on top of Debian, a free and open source Linux distribution.

The Ubuntu Desktop environment is based on GNOME.

Ubuntu is also used in servers, clouds and robots.

# History

Mark Shuttleworth founded Canonical with a team of Debian developers in 2004.

The development and maintenance of Ubuntu is funded by Canonical Ltd.

‘Warty Warthog’ — version 4.10 of Ubuntu — was launched in October 2004

# Business

Canonical creates open source software, including Ubuntu, freely to everyone.

It also provides features and support for enterprise users, who manage Ubuntu at scale.

Ubuntu's well-defined release cycle makes it a reliable OS for personal and corporate use.

# Release cycle

Each six months, a new version of Ubuntu is released.

Long term support (LTS) releases come every two years in April.

This regular cadence and the support provided, makes Ubuntu a highly-stable Linux distribution.
