# Software

Ubuntu on Desktop is designed to work out-of-the-box.

It comes pre-packaged with tools suitable for all users.

Developers can immediately run Python scripts without installing anything:

```bash
python3 myscript.py
```

To install additional packages you have a variety of options.

## Debian packages

```bash
sudo apt install <package>
```

## Snap

```bash
sudo snap install <package>
```

## App center

Press <kbd>super</kbd> and type `app center` to use a GUI tool for managing the installation and update of software.
