# How to install Ubuntu Desktop

Downloads of Ubuntu for different platforms can be found at [ubuntu.com/download](https://ubuntu.com/download).

For Desktop, navigate to [ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

## Desktop installation

### 1. Download an image

Select the release you wish to downloaded.

We recommend the latest LTS version.

### 2. Create a bootable USB drive

Make sure you have a USB stick with sufficient space.

Use a tool like [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to flash your USB with the image.

### 3. Boot into your device

With the USB flash drive inserted, boot into your device and follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu.

Choose the option for a full installation when given the option.
