# Ubuntu flavours

While many associate Ubuntu with the [GNOME desktop](/general/gnome-desktop), there are
many ways for users to enjoy Ubuntu Desktop.

Ubuntu flavours enable users to experience Ubuntu with different [desktop
environments](/general/desktop-environments), default applications, and more. These
are developed and maintained by community members and retain the full Ubuntu archive of
packages and updates.


## Kubuntu

Making use of [KDE]() and the [Plasma]() desktop, [Kubuntu]() delivers the same
reliability and ease-of-use as Ubuntu with a full suite of KDE desktop applications.

* [Download Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/)
* Check out the [Kubuntu forums](https://www.kubuntuforums.net/forum)


## Lubuntu

Built around the [LXQt]() desktop environment, [Lubuntu]() allows you to make the most
of limited-resource systems by packaging the most essential desktop features in a
modern, lightweight operating system.

* [Download Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/)
* Check out the [Lubuntu Discourse](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/flavors/lubuntu/343)


## Xubuntu

Xubuntu is built around the lightweight [Xfce]() desktop environment, providing all of
the features needed for effective usage. Xubuntu also serves as an excellent option
for users of older hardware, as its pre-installed suite of desktop apps is very
easy on system resources.

## Edubuntu

[Edubuntu]() is an official flavour designed to provide a stable, privacy-conscious
desktop experience for use in the education world.

[Budgie]() desktop environment.

## Ubuntu Cinnamon

Based on [GNOME 2](), the [Ubuntu Cinnamon]() desktop provides a traditional yet modern
experience with the [Cinnamon desktop](). This is the perfect flavour for those who
desire a simpler desktop experience without sacrificing the features that make Ubuntu
great.

## Ubuntu Kylin

[Ubuntu Kylin]() was designed from the ground-up to meet the needs of Chinese users.
The [Ubuntu Kylin User Interface]() serves as a great introduction to Linux, while
remaining light enough to run well on older hardware.
