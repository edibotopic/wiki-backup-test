# Test page

Originally written in **markdown**.

Then it was converted to *something else*.

---

## Goal

What happened:

* Changing to rich text also changed the source to HTML
* Reverting to a previous commit worked, but the rendering was messed up because the editor was still rich text
* Correct workflow simply is: convert back to markdown editor
