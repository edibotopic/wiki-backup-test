### but are wikis dead?

Not only are there successful examples of wikis (Arch), wikis have undergone
somewhat of a resurgence in recent years; however, most of the interesting developments have been in personal wikis (Obsidian, SilverBullet) -- can we learn something here?

Challenges
---

# Technical

* getting the charm and rock working
* migrating content from the old wikis

# Philosophical

* deciding what content should go in the wiki
* convincing some people that wikis aren't dead

# Organisational

* involving people: authors | engineers | community members

> [!warning]
> We are aware that some Canonical processes are partially embedded in the wiki

Opportunities
---

### The wiki allows us to **integrate** information

![](ubuntu-platform-ref.png)

Not always easy or advisable in product-specific documentation

<!-- end_slide -->

Opportunities
---

### The wiki is **for the broad Ubuntu community**

![](terminal-emulators.png)

Not just enterprise, not just professionals, not just engineers

<!-- end_slide -->

Opportunities
---

### The wiki is **easy**

![](wiki-is-easy.png)

---

Don't need to worry about Git or toc-trees, or Diataxis...

..._at least not right away_

Opportunities

### wiki != docs != chat != forum

If we approach our wiki expecting it to be like product documentation then
everyone will be unhappy

# Documentation

* **function**: enterprise-grade support
* **structure**: tightly organised and scoped
* **process**: gated, slow, technical
* **inputs**: features, APIs, fixes,...

<!-- column: 1 -->

## Wiki

* **function**: generate and connect information
* **structure**: loose and inter-connected
* **process**: open, fast, non-technical
* **inputs**: experiences, hacks, stories,...
