# Note on using the staging area

As a **trial user** you can only create new content in the staging area.

Content requiring approval can be posted under `/staging/proposals`.

Click **create new page** then choose an appropriate name, like `/staging/proposals/my-tutorial`.
Once the content has been approved, it will be included in the main wiki.

> If you try to create pages elsewhere, you will be denied access.
