# Diataxis

Documentation at Canonical is written according to the Diataxis model.

This groups documentation into the following four types:

* How-to
* Tutorial
* Reference
* Explanation

Diataxis helps you identity first *what you are writing* then *how it should be written*.
We expect any kind of technical writing to broadly follow this model.

You can find detailed overviews of Diataxis elsewhere. Below is a brief introduction to the four types.

## How-to

Showing someone the steps required to achieve a specific task.

May assume significant knowledge on the part of the person following the guide.

For example, outlining to someone comfortable with containerisation technologies how to configure a container.

## Tutorial

Teaching someone a skill, tool or process.

In following the tutorial, a person learns something that the previously did not know.
They can then apply that knowledge in new ways.

For example, guiding someone through the process of creating and running their first container.

## Reference

Giving someone a clear set of facts.

This type of content is usually for experts who need to find specific information fast.

For example, a list of terminal commands that can be used to interact with a container.

## Explanation

Providing conceptual background on a topic.

Explanations don't help someone achive any specific actions.
Instead, they help develop understanding.

For example, an explanation of when it is appropriate to use containers instead of virtual machines.
