# Diataxis

The Diataxis model can help you identity the type of content that you are writing when contributing to the wiki.

Diataxis groups documentation into the following four types:

* How-to
* Tutorial
* Reference
* Explanation

Diataxis helps you identity first *what you are writing* then *how it should be written*.

Below is a brief introduction to the four types.

## How-to

Showing someone the steps required to achieve a specific task.

May assume significant knowledge on the part of the person following the guide.

For example, outlining to someone comfortable with containerisation technologies how to configure a container.

## Tutorial

Teaching someone a skill, tool or process.

In following the tutorial, a person learns something that the previously did not know.
They can then apply that knowledge in new ways.

For example, guiding someone through the process of creating and running their first container.

## Reference

Giving someone a clear set of facts.

This type of content is usually for experts who need to find specific information fast.

For example, a list of terminal commands that can be used to interact with a container.

## Explanation

Providing conceptual background on a topic.

Explanations don't help someone achive any specific actions.
Instead, they help develop understanding.

For example, an explanation of when it is appropriate to use containers instead of virtual machines.

> Trying to contribute a how-to guide, which also functions as an explanation, and a reference, can be very demanding. Identifying the Diataxis type can help you stay focused on the key information.{.is-success}
